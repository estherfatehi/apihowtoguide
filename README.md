Created a website using a Bootstrap template on Github Pages using Github Desktop to commit changes. The organization and structure of the website was created by modifying the HTML file from Bootstrap. The website features some background information on what an API is, emphasis on Javascript objects and JSON, and goes over the USDA API and some example code on how to use it. The example code uses JSFiddle to demonstrate how to send an AJAX GET request, log the parsed JSON object into the console, and access the nested objects inside the response. Using some HTML, it then prints out some potentially useful objects from the response and goes over how they could be used.
